# GameSir Native Linux — contributor rules

## Project goal and release stage

Native, community-driven Linux support for the GameSir G7 Pro: gamepad
inputs, independent paddles, raw IMU and four motor channels. PRE-ALPHA only;
read README.md, docs/RELEASE_AUDIT.md and docs/PUBLIC_RELEASE_CHECK.md first.
Wider support and Linux-kernel inclusion are long-term goals.

## Work rules

Read the project state and existing implementation before changing it.
Extend existing code, keep changes small and distinguish confirmed evidence,
hypotheses and open questions. Run suitable offline tests and commit completed
changes locally. No public remote, tag, upload or push without explicit
maintainer approval. Preserve third-party notices and source provenance.
Own sources use GPL-2.0-only; preserve the UAPI Linux-syscall-note exception.

## Hardware safety

No module loading/unloading, driver rebinding, identity switch, active motor
or sensor test, installation or firmware access without separate explicit
authorization. Never flash firmware or guess undocumented device commands.
Document and verify the safe return to xpad. Deadband must retain a supported
exclusive maintenance path; normal play must not depend on it.

## Known boundaries

VID3537; standard PIDs100a/109c; ZZZ105e remains experimental. Keep existing
XInput/GIP/IMU formats and hardware-confirmed four-motor packet support.
8192 LSB/g is an interchangeable experimental accelerometer value. Gyro scale
is unknown; calibration is paused and calibrated SDL output is not approved.
No universal trigger-game support or general stability guarantee.

The optional `tools/offline` HID companion is file-only research, not runtime
authority. Read docs/XPAD_HID_PROTOTYPE.md before extending it. Existing captures
show brief 100a/IF1 telemetry but no proven activation or continuous stream.
Do not transmit the 8K heartbeat, apply report12 offsets, merge enumeration
epochs or loosen native IF0 gates from that evidence. Keep keyboard/mouse data
private and raw sensor units uncalibrated. Hardware transport requires new approval.
The passive 100a/300-second and separate 90-second recorders are test tools,
not an activation path. The 90-second recorder completed two separately approved
runs; only the second had verified normal XInput alongside short nonvendor HID,
with no vendor IMU telemetry observed. Read docs/HID_PASSIVE_CAPTURE_RESULTS.md
and docs/HID_PASSIVE_CAPTURE.md; never invoke the motor-test
coordinator for it. Require fresh source/boot/instance metadata, manager pause
and empty ownership. A blocked 109c lease must not be cleared or bypassed to
make a capture run. No release/resume, module load or recovery from test code.
The short profile is a stream-presence smoke test, not physical paddle mapping
or gyro calibration. Incomplete process inspection remains fail-closed;
report PID/operation/FD/errno without argv or private paths. Never bypass a
permission failure just because a descriptor appears to be a pseudo-FD.
Before another passive 100a test, verify an ordinary input consumer for the
exact IF0 instance, visible normal input and that the test client stays open.
The first run lacked that prerequisite and had no XInput completions. A bound
xpad interface alone does not prove its input receive path is active. Do not
open raw USB/HID or replay an initialization request to compensate.

Passive getter results are observations of one instance, never authority over
a replacement. Reconnect fixes must preserve actual faults, unknown-metadata
quarantine, parent/instance checks and start budgets. Read
docs/MANAGER_RECONNECT_FIX.md before changing this lifecycle. No automatic
error-text migration or repeated resume/rebind attempts on the running system.

## Optional trigger bridge

Keep game/Wine/SDL adapters and per-game gains in userspace. Use the existing
broker; never open USB/input nodes or bypass native ownership guards. Require
exact evdev-to-native-instance association and preserve zero/stop barriers.
Reject stale sessions rather than adopting replacement devices. Read
docs/TRIGGER_BRIDGE.md and its provenance audit before extending this path.
Revision 2 passed one approved Forza/Xodus run after a failed first trial:
both triggers, effect pauses/restarts, normal input/grip rumble and quiet
normal exit were confirmed. This does not validate reconnect, PM, crashes,
multiple devices or other games. Further live actions require new approval.
Steam/Proton is plan-only until its runtime is separately validated. Never
globally preload the hook into Steam
or a desktop session. Existing paddle mapping remains independent.
Read docs/STEAM_PROTON_TRIGGER_BRIDGE.md before implementing that adapter.
Prove host/container placement, peer-PID namespace mapping, exact source
identity and preload composition; never drop those guards to enable Steam.
Synthetic API tests are not game acceptance. No supporting game is currently
available for the planned Steam trigger test.

## Local static research tools

The optional `tools/research/rea_local` helper is separate from the runtime
driver. Its five static lanes use private copied inputs and a verified
network/device-isolated sandbox; never replace them with an unrestricted
REA/MCP invocation or execute/emulate a target. Keep raw results private.
Read the local-tool section of docs/GAMESIR_NEXUS_RESEARCH.md before use.
REA 6.5.0 has no built-in Jieli raw-code backend. A private local Ghidra
Pi32v2 processor description from pinned Quarkslab commit
`e1bd0707874b77b759401555d24839ad43af1267` is available for static analysis.
Its tested literal and 22-bit transfer forms matched known anchors in three
private app images; the tested transfers use `inst_next`, four bytes beyond
the former empirical target. The pinned SLEIGH source describes `E040` as
zero-extending, but this conflicts with the official Jieli-Tech
`fw-AC63_BT_SDK` Pi32v2 ROM listing at commit
`fdc018de81629e21e594d677cf05f87d288be0f0`: all 44 checked `E040`
immediates match sign extension and register selection, while 14 negative
values do not match zero extension. An isolated, private sign-extending
decoder variant finds 16 mask-entry patterns in each of three app images;
each branches to a shared handler whose decoded operations load a value,
AND it with the mask register, and store it back. This supports a generic
masked-update helper, not a sensor-register path. The decoder is incomplete;
never infer code/data boundaries, sensor writes, or `CTRL2_G` from numeric
matches alone. No target execution/emulation, hardware access, or driver
edit. Calibration remains paused and the driver unchanged.

## Public snapshot

This export omits private development-session instructions and consumed
hardware approvals. Historical reports are anonymized where indicated;
original evidence hashes remain historical. See PUBLIC_EXPORT.md and
PUBLIC_SOURCE_MANIFEST.json. No live system action is authorized by this tree.
